# The Decentralized FDA Mono-Repo

The mission of the Decentralized FDA is to create a decentralized, open-source, and community-driven platform for
discovering the positive and negative effects of every food, supplement, drug, and treatment on every measurable aspect of human health.

![Platform Diagram](assets/platform.png)

# Why a Monorepo

The Nx Monorepo is to achieve maximum interoperability and minimum duplication of effort between the various 
projects in order to maximize the speed of development and minimize costs.  This can be 
done by modularizing the codebase into libraries and plugins that can be shared between the various projects.

Apps in this monorepo:

- [dFDA-1](#dfda-1) - The first version of the decentralized FDA. It is a web app that allows users to track their health data and analyze it to identify the most effective ways to maximize health and happiness.
- Yours? - If you'd like to create the next version of the dFDA, expand its functionality, or get help with your app, feel free to add it to the [apps](apps) folder and submit a pull request.

## dFDA-1

dFDa-1 is an initial prototype of the decentralized FDA located in [apps/dfda-1](apps/dfda-1).  It is currently monolithic in nature, so a goal is to modularize it into a set of libraries and plugins that can be shared with other apps.

# Data Collection

## Web Notifications

Web and mobile push notifications with action buttons.

![web notification action buttons](assets/web-notification-action-buttons.png)

## Chrome Extension

By using the Chrome Extension, you can track your mood, symptoms, or any outcome you want to optimize in a fraction of a second using a unique popup interface.

## Data Analysis

The Analytics Engine mines data using powerful, proprietary algorithms which perform temporal precedence accounting, longitudinal data aggregation, erroneous data filtering, unit conversions, ingredient tagging, and variable grouping to quantify correlations between symptoms, treatments, and other factors.

It then pairs every combination of variables and identifies likely causal relationships using correlation mining algorithms in conjunction with a pharmacokinetic model.  The algorithms first identify the onset delay and duration of action for each hypothetical factor. It then identifies the optimal daily values for each factor.

Currently, the main apps are the [Demo Data Collection, Import, and Analysis App](https://app.curedao.org) and the
[Journal of Citizen Science](https://studies.curedao.org).

Try the [Demo Data Collection, Import, and Analysis App](https://app.curedao.org)

## API

For more info about the types of data you can store and get from the API, try out our
[Interactive API Explorer](https://curedao.readme.io) with the access token `demo`.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the project
2. Click the `Open in Gitpod` button below in YOUR forked repo.
3. Allow Gitpod to open port 5555.  It should then open the project in a new tab.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1eb1ddfea6092593649f0117f7262ffa8fbd3017/68747470733a2f2f676974706f642e696f2f627574746f6e2f6f70656e2d696e2d676974706f642e737667)](https://gitpod-referer.now.sh/api/gitpod-referer-redirect)

## Local Development

**Step 1**
üîß Fork the project

**Step 2**
‚è¨ Clone your forked version

**Step 3**
See the README's in the [apps](apps) and [libs](libs) folders for instructions on how to install and run the various projects.

# Using the API

_Application Programming Interface Specification_

The API facilitates storage and retrieval of any type of human generated data.

The API is documented in this [OpenAPI Specification](libs/dfda-api-spec/src/dfda-api-spec.openapi.yml).

It can be edited by:

1. downloading Stoplight Studio [here](https://stoplight.io/studio/)
2. opening this repo folder as a local project

## API Usage

Interactive API documentation is available at https://curedao.readme.io.  However, we have some examples below.

### Get Commonly Used Variables, Units, and Variable Categories

You can include the scripts in `data` folder following scripts in your HTML to get the commonly used variables, units, and variable categories.

```javascript
<script src="https://static.quantimo.do/data/variables.js"></script>
<script src="https://static.quantimo.do/data/units.js"></script>
<script src="https://static.quantimo.do/data/variableCategories.js"></script>
```

Then they'll be available in:

- Variable Categories: `qm.staticData.variableCategories`
- Units: `qm.staticData.units`
- Variables: `qm.staticData.commonVariables`

### Less Common Variables

There are over 87,000 additional variables accessible via the following API endpoint:

https://curedao.readme.io/reference/getvariables

```javascript
const options = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {Accept: 'application/json', Authorization: 'Bearer demo'}
};

fetch('https://app.quantimo.do/api/v3/variables?limit=100', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

## Getting Started

### Authentication

To use the CureDAO API, you first need to get an access token as described below.  Once you have the token, include it in any of the [API requests documented here](https://curedao.org/api-docs) using the `Authorization` header in the format `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`.

#### Option 1: Use Demo Data

If you don't have your own data yet, you can use the access token `demo` in the `Authorization` header in the format `Bearer demo`.

#### Option 2: Access Your Own Data

- Go to the [Settings](https://app.curedao.org/#/app/settings)
- Click copy your Personal Access Token
- Include it in your [API requests](https://curedao.org/api-docs) using the `Authorization` header in the format `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`

#### Option 3: Use it in Your Own App

- Go to the [App Builder](https://builder.curedao.org/#/app/configuration)
- Click `New App` and fill out the form
- Follow the OAuth integration instructions in the `Integration Guide` link

### Common API Usage Examples

Instead of using this SDK, you can also use the requests in our [interactive API documentation](https://curedao.org/api-docs).  Just click the dots to the right of the "LANGUAGE" section and select `Node` or `Javascript`.  Then you can just copy the request for usage in your project.

Here are some common usages:

- [Get Units](https://curedao.readme.io/reference/getunits)
- [Get Variables](https://curedao.readme.io/reference/getvariables)
- [Get Variable Categories](https://curedao.readme.io/reference/getvariablecategories)
