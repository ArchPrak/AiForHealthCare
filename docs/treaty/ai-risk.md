# The 1% Treaty: Averting AI Catastrophe Through Global Demilitarization

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) advancements hold the potential to redefine warfare, humanity faces an unprecedented existential challenge. The prospect of an AI arms race, with nations vying for supremacy in military AI technologies, poses threats far beyond traditional conflicts, edging us closer to potential catastrophe. The 1% Treaty, proposing that countries allocate just 1% of their military budgets towards AI safety and ethical research, stands as a crucial initiative to counteract these dangers, fostering a collaborative global approach to prevent AI-induced human extinction.

## The Looming Threats of the AI Arms Race

The AI arms race carries inherent risks that are distinct and potentially more perilous than any technological competition humanity has faced:

- **Autonomous Decision-making**: AI systems capable of making lethal decisions without human intervention present an unpredictable threat. Unlike humans, who possess moral judgment and fear of mutual destruction, AI lacks such constraints, potentially leading to unintended escalations.
- **Acceleration and Opaqueness**: The pace at which AI technologies can evolve surpasses traditional arms development, making it difficult for regulatory bodies to keep up. Additionally, the opaque nature of AI algorithms can obscure their decision-making processes, making it challenging to predict or control their actions in conflict scenarios.
- **Cyber and Physical Vulnerabilities**: Military AI applications extend to cyber operations, where AI can exploit vulnerabilities at speeds and with a level of sophistication unattainable by humans. Physical security is equally at risk, with drones and autonomous vehicles opening new fronts in warfare that can be difficult to defend against.
- **Global Instability**: The diffusion of AI technologies means that not only state actors but also non-state actors could acquire capabilities to conduct high-impact operations, potentially destabilizing regions or triggering international conflicts.

## Strengthening the 1% Treaty's Role in Mitigating Risks

To effectively address these threats, the 1% Treaty must go beyond merely reallocating military budgets, embodying a comprehensive framework for global AI governance:

- **International Standards and Regulations**: Establishing clear international standards for the development, deployment, and use of military AI, ensuring that all technologies are aligned with ethical guidelines and controlled to prevent autonomous engagements.
- **Transparency Mechanisms**: Promoting transparency in AI development to facilitate mutual understanding and trust among nations. This includes shared databases of AI research, development protocols, and incident reporting to prevent escalations from misunderstandings.
- **Robust Verification and Enforcement**: Implementing stringent verification measures to ensure compliance with treaty obligations, paired with enforcement mechanisms to address violations, is critical for the treaty's credibility and effectiveness.
- **Global Collaboration on AI Safety**: Encouraging the global scientific community to engage in AI safety research, funded by the treaty's allocations, to tackle the alignment problem—ensuring AI systems' goals are congruent with human values and safety requirements.

The risks associated with the AI arms race necessitate immediate and unified action to prevent a drift towards catastrophe. The 1% Treaty offers a visionary yet pragmatic approach to demilitarization, aiming to repurpose a fraction of the world's military expenditures towards ensuring AI benefits humanity rather than leading to its demise. By addressing the multifaceted threats of an unregulated AI arms race and fostering an environment of cooperation and safety, the treaty paves the way for a future where technological advancements are synonymous with global security and prosperity. In the face of AI's dual-use nature, the choice to embrace demilitarization and collaborative governance is not just strategic—it's essential for our survival.
