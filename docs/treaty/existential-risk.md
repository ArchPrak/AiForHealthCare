# Why Current Military Spending is Excessive

If you simply consider one part of military spending, nuclear weapons, we already have 13,000 nuclear weapons. This is enough to cause between 13 and 130 "extinction-level events" if you account for the effects of nuclear winter.  

Even if you believe some level of military spending is warranted, we certainly don't need to be able to exterminate the human race more than once.

## Calculations

Given the rough estimate that 100 to 1,000 nuclear detonations could potentially trigger a nuclear winter sufficient to cause global agricultural collapse and widespread famine, potentially endangering the majority of the world's population, the concept of "extinction-level events" becomes more nuanced when considering the long-term environmental impact rather than direct fatalities alone.

If we work with the assumption from earlier calculations that the entire global nuclear arsenal (approximately 13,000 warheads) has the "theoretical kill capability" to exterminate the world's population approximately 1.625 times based solely on direct impacts, incorporating the effects of nuclear winter complicates the picture:

- **Direct Impact**: Without considering nuclear winter, 13,000 warheads could theoretically kill the global population 1.625 times.
- **Nuclear Winter Impact**: If 100 to 1,000 warheads are sufficient to trigger a catastrophic nuclear winter potentially leading to the majority of the global population's demise, then the arsenal could cause the conditions for global catastrophe many times over.

### Theoretical Extinction-Level Events Calculation

- **Lower Bound (100 warheads/event)**: With 13,000 warheads, you could have 130 "events" where each event is defined as a scenario sufficient to potentially trigger a nuclear winter.
- **Upper Bound (1,000 warheads/event)**: With 13,000 warheads, you could have 13 "events," where each event represents a larger scale scenario sufficient to potentially trigger a nuclear winter.

### Conclusion

Based on the assumption that between 100 and 1,000 warheads could cause catastrophic global climate effects leading to widespread famine and societal collapse, the global nuclear arsenal could theoretically cause between 13 and 130 "extinction-level events." This calculation frames the concept of "extinction-level events" in terms of potential to trigger widespread ecological and societal collapse, rather than direct fatalities alone.
