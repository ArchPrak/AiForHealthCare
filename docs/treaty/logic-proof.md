# Logical Proof

Why it is logical for the nations and citizens of the world to sign the 1% Treaty and reallocate 1% of military spending to medical research each year:

## Axioms:

1. Reducing death and suffering is a worthy goal.
2. War increases death and suffering.
3. Medical research reduces death and suffering.
4. Resources spent on war cannot be spent on medical research.
5. Countries act in their self-interest.

## Premises:

1. The world has finite resources.
2. Resources spent on war are 20 times greater than resources spent on medical research.
3. AI technology developed for warfare could lead to catastrophic outcomes like a Skynet scenario.
4. People generally prefer resources to be used for medical research over warfare.
5. No individual country can unilaterally reallocate war resources to medical research without risking attack from other countries.

## Propositions:

1. An international treaty where all countries allocate 1% of military budgets to medical research would maintain the balance of power while increasing resources for medical research.
2. Reducing military budgets by 1% and allocating that to medical research would increase net national security by reducing the risk of AI-driven catastrophe.
3. Using a decentralized crowdfunding platform to allocate medical research funds would be more effective than centralized government allocation.
4. Robust auditing and verification mechanisms can ensure countries comply with the treaty.
5. Implementing the 1% Treaty could yield \$1.2 million in benefits per capita globally over 80 years.

## Proof:

1. Resources spent on war cannot be spent on medical research. (Axiom 4)
2. Resources spent on war are 20 times the resources spent on medical research. (Premise 2)
3. Therefore, reallocating some resources from war to medical research would increase resources for medical research. (From 1 and 2)
4. An international treaty for all countries to reallocate resources maintains the balance of power. (Proposition 1)
5. Therefore, an international 1% treaty would increase resources for medical research while maintaining geopolitical stability. (From 3 and 4)
6. AI weapons could lead to catastrophic Skynet-like scenarios. (Premise 3)
7. Reducing AI weapons development reduces catastrophic risk. (From 6)
8. The 1% treaty reduces resources for weapons, including AI weapons. (From Proposition 1)
9. Therefore, the 1% treaty reduces catastrophic AI risk, increasing net security. (From 7 and 8, Proposition 2)
10. Decentralized crowdfunding is more effective than centralized allocation. (Proposition 3)
11. Therefore, decentralized crowdfunding for the 1% medical research fund is optimal. (From 5 and 10)
12. Auditing and verification ensure compliance. (Proposition 4)
13. Therefore, the 1% Treaty is executable in a verifiable way. (From 5 and 12)
14. The 1% Treaty could yield \$1.2 million per person in global benefits. (Proposition 5)
15. Therefore, the 1% Treaty provides significant net benefits to humanity. (From 14)
16. Reducing death and suffering is a worthy goal. (Axiom 1)
17. Medical research reduces death and suffering. (Axiom 3)
18. The 1% Treaty increases medical research. (From 5)
19. Therefore, the 1% Treaty reduces death and suffering. (From 16, 17, 18)

## Conclusion:

The 1% Treaty, which reallocates a portion of military spending to medical research in a stable, decentralized, and verifiable way, would reduce catastrophic risks, increase resources for beneficial research, and yield significant humanitarian benefits. Therefore, the 1% Treaty is a desirable and achievable policy we should strive to implement.
