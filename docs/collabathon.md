#  Collabathon

##  The Problem with Hackathons

Traditional hackathons are great.  But they have two main problems:
1. Duplication of Effort - Many teams work on the same problem, but they don't know about each other, so they end up duplicating each other's work.
2. Lack of Follow-Through - Over 90% of hackathon projects just die after the hackathon is over, so all the work is wasted.
3. Unfair Rewards Discourage Contribution - Like group homework assignments, hackathons can incentivize free-riding and discourage collaboration. i.e., One person does most of the work and everyone else gets the rewards. This disincentivizes contributions from the most talented people. 

##  The Solution: Collabathon

A Collabathon is like a hackathon, but everyone works together on the same GitHub repository.  Participants can make pull requests containing documentation, libraries, apps, or anything else that can help the project.  

Then judges [vote](contributing/voting.md) on whether to accept each pull request and how much to reward the contributor.  This incentivizes collaboration and rewards the most talented contributors.  It also prevents duplication/waste of effort and ensures that the project continues to evolve after the Collabathon is over.

The repository for a Collabathon should have a [modular mono-repo structure](contributing/repo-structure.md) and primarily consist of:
- [FAIR](contributing/fair.md) [libraries](contributing/repo-structure.md)
- [apps](contributing/repo-structure.md) that use these libraries
- documentation
- issues
- tests

##  Collabathon Planning

Strategies to increase the chances of success:

####  1. Clearly Defined and Impactful Challenges
- **Focus on Real-World Problems**: Choose challenges that have a direct impact on real-world issues. This not only makes the work more meaningful but also more engaging.
- **Modular Challenges**: Break down the FDAi framework into smaller, more manageable challenges. This allows participants to focus on specific aspects and contribute more effectively.

####  2. Pre-Event Workshops and Educational Content
- **Skill-Building Workshops**: Host workshops before the event to help participants brush up on necessary skills, such as using GitHub effectively, understanding the FDAi framework, or advanced coding techniques.
- **Educational Resources**: Provide learning materials that can help participants understand the context and technical aspects of the FDAi framework.

####  3. Mentorship and Expert Guidance
- **Assign Mentors**: Have a team of experts available to mentor participants. This can include technical experts, industry professionals, or even previous Collabathon participants.
- **Office Hours**: Schedule times when mentors are available to answer questions, provide guidance, or troubleshoot problems.

####  4. Community Building and Networking Opportunities
- **Discussion Forums**: Create online forums or chat rooms where participants can network, share ideas, and seek or offer help.
- **Social Events**: Organize virtual meet-and-greets or social hours to foster a sense of community and networking.

####  5. Effective Communication and Transparency
- **Regular Updates**: Keep participants informed about the progress of the event, any changes in schedules, or additional resources.
- **Transparent Judging Process**: Ensure that the criteria and process for evaluating contributions and awarding prizes are clear and transparent.

####  6. Post-Event Engagement and Acknowledgment
- **Showcase Contributions**: Highlight successful projects or contributions on social media, in newsletters, or through webinars.
- **Continued Involvement**: Encourage participants to stay involved with the project after the Collabathon. This could be through ongoing development, community forums, or future events.

####  7. Gamification Elements
- **Leaderboards**: Use leaderboards to track and display participant contributions, fostering a friendly competitive environment.
- **Badges and Certificates**: Award digital badges or certificates for various achievements, encouraging continued participation and learning.

####  8. Feedback and Improvement
- **Post-Event Survey**: Conduct a survey to gather feedback from participants about their experience. Use this feedback to improve future events.

####  9. Marketing and Outreach
- **Targeted Marketing**: Reach out to communities, universities, and organizations where you can find individuals interested in healthcare, technology, and open-source projects.
- **Influencer Involvement**: Involve industry influencers or thought leaders to promote the event and attract a wider audience.

####  10. Inclusivity and Accessibility
- **Diverse Participation**: Actively promote diversity and inclusion in your participant outreach to ensure a wide range of perspectives.
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Make sure the event is accessible to all, including considerations for different time zones, languages, and potential disabilities.

By incorporating these strategies, the Collabathon can become more than just an event; it can transform into a launching pad for sustained, community-driven development towards the FDAi framework, fostering a dedicated and motivated group of contributors.

##  For Participants

####  The FDAi Framework

The FDAi is looking for partners to quantify the personalized safety and effectiveness of foods, drugs, and other interventions. We need three fundamental components:

1. **Data Silo API Gateway Nodes**: Enable seamless data export from various health data sources.
2. **PersonalFDA Nodes**: Import and analyze personal health data, offering insights into individual health impacts.
3. **Clinipedia**: A vast repository of data on the effects of foods, drugs, and treatments.

**Autonomous Agents**
- These agents will form a global network, enhancing the FDA's ability to make data-driven, personalized health decisions.
- Imagine a future where AI autonomously navigates vast data landscapes to deliver precise, individualized healthcare insights!
