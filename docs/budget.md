- Research and Alignment: $3,000
- Testing and Refinement: $20,000
- Documentation and Release: $5,000 + $2,000 = $7,000

Total high-end estimate (without continuous improvement fund): $167,000

Adding up the costs at the low end of the estimates:
- Collabathon and Talent Acquisition: $5,000 + $3,000 + $80,000 = $88,000
- Research and Alignment: $1,000
- Testing and Refinement: $10,000
- Documentation and Release: $2,000 + $1,000 = $3,000

Total low-end estimate (without continuous improvement fund): $102,000

Therefore, the total expected annual cost for the project, based on the estimates provided, would be in the range of **$102,000 to $167,000** excluding any discretionary funds for continuous improvements.
