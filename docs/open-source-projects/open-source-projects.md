# Open Source Projects to Accelerate Clinical Discovery

## Introduction

The goal of the dFDA is to coordinate between open-source projects to accelerate clinical discovery. We can only do this if we know what projects are out there. This page is a list of open-source projects that are relevant to the dFDA's mission. If you know of any projects that should be added to this list, please add your project to this list and [submit a pull request](../contributing/contributing.md).
