## How to add a new API

1. Create a new lib for the API spec file (replace `my-api-name` with the name of the API):

```sh
nx generate @trumbitta/nx-plugin-openapi:api-spec
```
✔ What name would you like to use? 
```
A: my-api-name-api-spec
```

✔ Do you want me to also create a sample spec file for you? (y/N) 
```
A: true
```

2. Paste the API spec file in the newly created `my-api-name-api-spec` file in the [libs](libs) folder.


3.  Create an API client library from the spec file (replace `my-api-name` with the name of the API):

```sh
nx generate @trumbitta/nx-plugin-openapi:api-lib
```
✔ What name would you like to use? 
```
· my-api-name-sdk-typescript-fetch
```
✔ Which OpenAPITool generator would you like to use?  
```
· typescript-fetch
```
✔ Is the API spec file published online? (y/N)
```
· false
```
✔ If online, what is the URL where I can get the API spec file from?
```
·
```
✔ If online, which authorization headers do you need to add?
```
·
```
✔ If local, what is the name of the lib containing the API spec file?
```
· my-api-name-api-spec
```
✔ If local, what is the path of the API spec file starting from the lib root?
```
· src/my-api-name-api-spec.openapi.yml
```

4. Create an API docs library from the spec file (replace `my-api-name` with the name of the API):

### Generate or update sources

Given the libs created in the examples above, then:

`nx run api-docs:generate-sources`

### Then you can simply serve it
`npx http-server libs/api-docs/src`

Or you can configure a Nx serve target for it, or do whatever you want
