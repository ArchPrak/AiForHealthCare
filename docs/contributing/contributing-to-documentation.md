# ‚úèÔ∏è Contributing to Documentation

A **Pull Request** (PR) is a method used on GitHub to suggest changes to a repository (a place where code is stored). It's like saying, "I've made some changes; please review them and add them to the main project if they're good."

When you submit a PR, you're asking the repository maintainers to review your changes and merge them into the main codebase if they agree with your modifications.

## Why Submit a Pull Request?

- **Contribute to a Project**: If you find a typo, a bug, or see an opportunity for improvement, a pull request lets you contribute your changes.
- **Collaborate with Others**: PRs allow you to discuss your changes with project maintainers and collaborate to refine your contribution.

## How to Submit a Pull Request

### Step 1: Find the File You Want to Edit
- Navigate to the repository where you want to make a change.
- Find the file you want to edit. It could be a code file, a README, or any other document in the repository.

### Step 2: Edit the File
- Click on the file in the repository.
- To edit the file, click the pencil icon (üñâ) in the top right corner of the file view.
- Make your changes in the online editor.

### Step 3: Propose Your Changes
- After making changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page.
- Enter a title and description for your changes in the provided fields. Be as clear as possible about what you changed and why.
- Click **Propose file change**.

### Step 4: Create the Pull Request
- After proposing your file change, you'll be taken to a new page titled "Comparing changes".
- Review your changes to ensure they are correct.
- Click the green **Create pull request** button.
- Add any additional comments about your changes, then click **Create pull request** again.

### Step 5: Wait for Review
- Once you've submitted the PR, the project maintainers will review it.
- You might receive comments or questions about your changes.
- If the maintainers approve your changes, they will merge them into the project. If not, they may ask for further modifications or explain why the changes can't be merged.
