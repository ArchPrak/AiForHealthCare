# Cost Savings

Research indicates that the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare could result in significant cost savings. A study highlighted by CEPR suggests that within the next five years, utilizing current AI technology could save 5% to 10% of healthcare spending, translating to $200 to $360 billion annually. These savings are expected not to compromise the quality or accessibility of healthcare services; in fact, they might enhance the quality of healthcare experiences for patients.

This substantial reduction in healthcare spending can be attributed to several factors facilitated by AI, including improved efficiency in healthcare delivery, enhanced accuracy in diagnosis and treatment planning, reductions in unnecessary interventions, and optimized resource allocation. AI's potential to transform healthcare through personalized medicine, early detection of diseases, and streamlined clinical trials aligns with the objectives of projects like the FDAi Act, suggesting that similar savings could be anticipated with its implementation.
