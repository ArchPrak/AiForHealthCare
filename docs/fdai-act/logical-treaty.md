# LOGICAL Treaty

## Facts:

1. **2 billion people suffer** from chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and many others. This causes immense human anguish as well as crippling economic costs.
2. **Medical research** to find cures for these diseases remains far **too slow** to meet the desperate needs of patients.
3. **Artificial intelligence** can radically accelerate the clinical research process by **automating **analysis of medical data, identifying promising drug targets, optimizing clinical trial designs, and more.
4. A global collaborative effort to deploy AI to automate clinical research, coordinated and governed by the people, could produce revolutionary breakthroughs against chronic diseases and **alleviate the suffering of billions of people.**

## Logical Proof:

Here is the logical proof that signing this accord is the most rational thing you can do with the next few moments of your life:

1. Governments currently spend over $2 trillion per year on their militaries. They don’t do this because they like blowing up other people and their stuff. They do this to maintain the balance of power against other nations that might blow them up.

2. However, if every nation agreed to reallocate just 1% of their annual military expenditures to a global medical research fund:

  * The relative balance of power would remain unchanged. So, despite spending less on the military, they would be at no greater relative risk of being murdered by another country.
  * The entire world would benefit from the resulting health advances and cures for diseases.

3. Therefore, it is clearly in your rational self-interest to sign this treaty requesting that all nations to cooperate in this endeavor. By contributing a infinitesimal portion of their military budgets, they can help unlock revolutionary health benefits for their own citizens and the world at large.

## How it Works:

1. Every participating nation will pledge **1% of its annual military budget** to the Global AI Health Research Fund. For example, if global military spending is $2 trillion per year, this would create a $20 billion annual fund. Participation from all nations is essential to maintain geopolitical stability.
2. The **fund will support AI-driven research projects** aimed at discovering new treatments, cures, and early-detection methods for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and other chronic diseases that take the heaviest toll on human health worldwide.
3. Research institutions, medical centers, and AI labs around the world will be invited to **submit project proposals** to the fund. These proposals will be reviewed and ranked by a global panel of experts based on their scientific merit, feasibility, and potential impact.
4. However, the final decision on which projects receive funding will be **made democratically** by the global public. Using a platform similar to Gitcoin, anyone in the world will be able to vote on the proposals they believe hold the most promise. This crowdsourced approach ensures that the fund remains accountable to the people and focused on the projects that matter most to them.
5. All research findings and data generated through the fund will be made openly available in real-time to the global scientific community, **accelerating progress** and enabling rapid translation of discoveries into new medicines and improved clinical practices worldwide.
6. Participating nations and research institutions will collaborate continuously through a state-of-the-art online platform, sharing knowledge, best practices, and resources to **maximize the impact of every research dollar** and speed the deployment of new health solutions to patients everywhere.

By combining the power of AI, the resources of global crowdfunding, and the collective wisdom of the world’s people, we can transform the fight against chronic disease. The resulting breakthroughs will improve health, extend lives, boost economies, and benefit every nation on Earth.


# The Annual Cost of War

## Direct Costs:

1. **Military Expenditure: $1,981 billion.** This reflects the total global spending on armed forces, including salaries, operations, maintenance, and procurement of weapons and equipment.
2. **Economic Impact of Conflict: $521 billion.** Costs incurred due to the immediate effects of war, such as destruction of property, loss of life, and the displacement of people.
3. **Infrastructure Destruction: $1,875 billion.** Represents the cost to repair or replace infrastructure damaged or destroyed during conflicts, including roads, bridges, and utilities.
4. **Trade and Investment Disruption: $616 billion.** Estimated losses from interruptions in trade flows and deterred investments in conflict zones or areas under threat.

## Indirect Costs:

1. **Human Costs: $1,000 billion (using statistical value of life).** Calculated by applying a monetary value to the loss of life, this figure represents the cost of human casualties of war.
2. **Opportunity Costs: Lost economic benefits from military spending.** Resources spent on military endeavors could have been used for other societal needs, such as education or healthcare.
3. **Multiplier Effect: Additional economic activity from productive investment.** Reflects the lost economic growth that could have been generated if resources were invested in productive sectors rather than military spending.
4. **Long-term Healthcare for Veterans: $200 billion.** Costs associated with providing ongoing medical care, rehabilitation, and support services to veterans injured during military service.
5. **Psychological Impacts on Populations: $100 billion.** Expenses related to treating mental health issues like PTSD, depression, and anxiety stemming from the trauma of war.

8. **Refugee Support: $150 billion.** Expenses for providing assistance to refugees, including shelter, food, healthcare, and integration services.

## Calculations and Equations:

- **Human Cost of War:** `Annual Deaths × Statistical Value of Life`
- **Total Direct Costs:** `Military Expenditure + Economic Impact of Conflict + Infrastructure Destruction + Trade and Investment Disruption`
- **Total Indirect Costs:** `Human Costs + Long-term Healthcare for Veterans + Psychological Impacts on Populations + Loss of Human Capital + Environmental Degradation + Refugee Support`
- **Updated Total Annual Cost of War:** `Total Direct Costs + Total Indirect Costs`

### Total Annual Cost of War:

- **Direct Costs Total:** $4,993 billion.
- **Indirect Costs Total:** $2,245.25 billion.
- **Updated Total Annual Cost:** $7,238.25 billion.

### Total Cost to the Average Person Over Their Lifetime

Assuming a global population of 7.8 billion and an average lifespan of 80 years:

1. **Annual Per Capita Cost:** $7,238.25 billion / 7.8 billion = $928.24
2. **Lifetime Cost Per Person:** $928.24 × 80 years = $74,259.2

### Insights

The comprehensive annual cost of war, factoring in both direct and updated indirect costs, is approximately $7,238.25 billion. This equates to a staggering cost of about $74,259.2 per person over an 80-year lifespan, underscoring the profound economic and human impacts of global conflicts.

## Cumulative Savings from Decreased Annual Cost of War

Given the initial annual cost of war is approximately $7,238.25 billion, we explore the scenario where this cost decreases by 1% every year for 80 years. This decrease reflects potential efficiencies, peacekeeping successes, and the reallocation of resources towards more productive and peaceful endeavors. Here's how the calculations unfold:

## Initial Assumptions:

- **Initial Annual Cost of War:** $7,238.25 billion.
- **Annual Decrease Rate:** 1% per year.
- **Duration:** 80 years.
- **Global Population:** 7.8 billion.

## Calculations:

1. **Total Cost with Decrease:** We calculate the total cost over 80 years, taking into account the 1% annual decrease. This involves summing up the cost for each year, where each subsequent year's cost is 1% less than the previous year's.

2. **Total Cost without Decrease:** For comparison, we calculate what the total cost would have been if it remained constant at $7,238.25 billion per year over 80 years.

3. **Cumulative Savings:** The difference between the total cost without the decrease and the total cost with the decrease gives us the cumulative savings over 80 years.

4. **Per Capita Savings:** To determine the impact on an individual level, we divide the cumulative savings by the global population of 7.8 billion.

## Results:

- **Cumulative Savings:** Approximately $179 trillion over 80 years.
- **Per Capita Savings:** Approximately $22,969.68 per person over 80 years.

By reducing the annual cost of war by a modest 1% annually over the course of 80 years, the global community could save nearly $179.16 trillion, translating to almost $23,000 in savings per person.

# Transformative Impact of Redirecting War Savings to Healthcare Innovation

The global cost of conflict is staggering, not just in human lives but also in economic terms. By imagining the redirection of $179,163.49 billion, initially earmarked for warfare over 80 years, towards healthcare innovation, we explore the potential to save lives, reduce disability, and significantly impact the global economy.

### Assumptions

### Total Economic Benefit

The total economic benefit is approximately $1,113,745 billion. This figure reflects the unparalleled impact of fully harnessing AI and healthcare innovation to cure disease.

# Per Capita Economic Benefit of Automated Clinical Research

The transformative potential of redirecting funds from warfare to healthcare innovation can be further understood by examining the per capita economic benefits. This scenario optimistically assumes a 50% increase in R&D efficiency through AI, saving 50 million lives, reducing 500 million disability years, and boosting global productivity by 5%.

## Calculation

Given the total economic benefit of approximately $1,113,745 billion from redirecting war savings towards healthcare innovation, and considering the global population of 7.8 billion, we can calculate the per capita benefit as follows:

Per Capita Total Economic Benefit = Total Economic Benefit / Global Population = **$142,787.82** per person

This figure represents the economic value that could be realized on an individual level if the substantial funds currently allocated to warfare were instead invested in maximizing the potential of healthcare innovation.

The redirection of funds from warfare to healthcare innovation presents an opportunity to significantly improve global health outcomes and economic prosperity. From saving millions of lives to enhancing productivity and reducing disabilities, the potential benefits are immense.

By automating clinical research we can unlock unprecedented levels of health, well-being, and economic growth, creating a lasting legacy of peace and prosperity.

# $142k for 5 Hours of Your Time

Historical examples show that petitions with support from over 1% of the population have a high likelihood of being adopted. So all you have to do is

## Factors Influencing Time Investment

1. **Number of Friends:** The average number of significant relationships one might actively maintain, often cited as Dunbar's number, is around 150.

2. **Method of Communication:** Personal messages or emails are considered for this estimation, assuming they strike a balance between personal touch and efficiency.

3. **Time Per Friend:** It's estimated that drafting and sending a personal message or email would take approximately 2 minutes per friend. This includes the time to write the message and possibly tailor it slightly for each friend.

## Calculation

Given the average number of friends (150) and the estimated time per friend (2 minutes), the total time investment can be calculated as follows:

- **Total Friends:** 150
- **Time per Friend:** 2 minutes

Total Time = Number of Friends × Time per Friend
= 150 friends × 2 minutes/friend
= 300 minutes

Converting this into hours:

Total Time in Hours = Total Time in Minutes / 60
= 300 minutes / 60
= 5 hours

Based on this estimation, an average person would need to invest approximately 5 hours to individually reach out to all 150 of their friends via personal messages or emails about the treaty. This calculation assumes a brief but personalized communication method, emphasizing the importance of each conversation in promoting global initiatives.
