### Total Cost to the Average Person Over Their Lifetime

Assuming a global population of 7.8 billion and an average lifespan of 80 years:

1. **Annual Per Capita Cost:** $7,238.25 billion / 7.8 billion = $928.24
2. **Lifetime Cost Per Person:** $928.24 × 80 years = $74,259.2

### Insights

The comprehensive annual cost of war, factoring in both direct and updated indirect costs, is approximately $7,238.25 billion. This equates to a staggering cost of about $74,259.2 per person over an 80-year lifespan, underscoring the profound economic and human impacts of global conflicts.

## Cumulative Savings from Decreased Annual Cost of War

Given the initial annual cost of war is approximately $7,238.25 billion, we explore the scenario where this cost decreases by 1% every year for 80 years. This decrease reflects potential efficiencies, peacekeeping successes, and the reallocation of resources towards more productive and peaceful endeavors. Here's how the calculations unfold:

## Initial Assumptions:

- **Initial Annual Cost of War:** $7,238.25 billion.
- **Annual Decrease Rate:** 1% per year.
- **Duration:** 80 years.
- **Global Population:** 7.8 billion.

## Calculations:

1. **Total Cost with Decrease:** We calculate the total cost over 80 years, taking into account the 1% annual decrease. This involves summing up the cost for each year, where each subsequent year's cost is 1% less than the previous year's.

2. **Total Cost without Decrease:** For comparison, we calculate what the total cost would have been if it remained constant at $7,238.25 billion per year over 80 years.

3. **Cumulative Savings:** The difference between the total cost without the decrease and the total cost with the decrease gives us the cumulative savings over 80 years.

4. **Per Capita Savings:** To determine the impact on an individual level, we divide the cumulative savings by the global population of 7.8 billion.

## Results:

- **Cumulative Savings:** Approximately $179 trillion over 80 years.
- **Per Capita Savings:** Approximately $22,969.68 per person over 80 years.

By reducing the annual cost of war by a modest 1% annually over the course of 80 years, the global community could save nearly $179.16 trillion, translating to almost $23,000 in savings per person.

# Transformative Impact of Redirecting War Savings to Healthcare Innovation

Historical examples show that petitions with support from over 1% of the population have a high likelihood of being adopted. So all you have to do is

## Factors Influencing Time Investment

1. **Number of Friends:** The average number of significant relationships one might actively maintain, often cited as Dunbar's number, is around 150.

2. **Method of Communication:** Personal messages or emails are considered for this estimation, assuming they strike a balance between personal touch and efficiency.

3. **Time Per Friend:** It's estimated that drafting and sending a personal message or email would take approximately 2 minutes per friend. This includes the time to write the message and possibly tailor it slightly for each friend.

## Calculation

Given the average number of friends (150) and the estimated time per friend (2 minutes), the total time investment can be calculated as follows:

- **Total Friends:** 150
- **Time per Friend:** 2 minutes

Total Time = Number of Friends × Time per Friend
= 150 friends × 2 minutes/friend
= 300 minutes

Converting this into hours:

Total Time in Hours = Total Time in Minutes / 60
= 300 minutes / 60
= 5 hours

Based on this estimation, an average person would need to invest approximately 5 hours to individually reach out to all 150 of their friends via personal messages or emails about the treaty. This calculation assumes a brief but personalized communication method, emphasizing the importance of each conversation in promoting global initiatives.

Remember, the actual time could vary depending on how in-depth the conversations go and whether other communication methods are used in tandem, such as social media posts or phone calls, which could reach multiple friends simultaneously or require more time per conversation, respectively.
