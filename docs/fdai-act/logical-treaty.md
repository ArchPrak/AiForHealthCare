# Quantitative Cost-Benefit Analysis

## 1. Opportunity Cost of Military Spending:
- **Global military expenditure in 2020:** $1,981 billion
- **1% reallocation to FDAi:** $19.81 billion annually
- **Potential economic gain from productive investment of reallocated funds (assuming a 1.5x multiplier effect):** $29.72 billion annually

## 2. Direct Health Benefits:
- **Global economic burden of chronic diseases:** $47 trillion over the next 20 years
- **Potential reduction in disease burden through AI-driven research (assuming a conservative 10% reduction):** $4.7 trillion over 20 years
- **Equivalent annual benefit:** $235 billion

## 3. Indirect Economic Benefits:
- **Estimated annual global cost of conflict-related losses, infrastructure destruction, trade disruption, and resource diversion:** $3.45 trillion
- **Potential annual savings from 1% reduction in these costs:** $34.5 billion
- **Potential annual gain from productive investment of these savings (assuming a 1.5x multiplier):** $51.75 billion

## 4. Long-Term Economic Growth:
- **Potential increase in global GDP growth due to healthier populations and increased productivity (assuming a conservative 0.1 percentage point increase):** $88 billion annually, based on 2020 global GDP

## 5. Benefits of a World Without War:
- **Estimated net present value of a world without war:** $24 quadrillion globally, or approximately $3 million per person over a lifetime
- **Assuming a gradual realization of these benefits over the lifetime of a person born today (72 years), the annual benefit would be:** $333.3 trillion

## 6. Net Present Value (NPV) over the lifetime of a person born today (72 years):
- **Annual benefits:** $29.72 billion (reallocated funds) + $235 billion (reduced disease burden) + $51.75 billion (reduced conflict costs) + $88 billion (increased GDP growth) + $333.3 trillion (benefits of a world without war) = $333.7 trillion
- **NPV at a 3% discount rate over 72 years:** $10.2 quadrillion

## 7. Per Capita Lifetime NPV:
- **Assuming a global population of 7.9 billion:** $1.3 million per person

## 8. Comparison to Costs:
- **Annual 1% reallocation of military expenditures:** $19.81 billion
- **Lifetime benefit-to-cost ratio:** $10.2 quadrillion / ($19.81 billion × 72 years) = 7,163
- **Every $1 invested in the LOGICAL Fund over a person's lifetime is expected to generate $7,163 in economic and human benefits.**

These revised figures, incorporating the estimated benefits of a world without war, further underscore the immense potential of the LOGICAL Treaty. The lifetime NPV of $10.2 quadrillion and the per capita lifetime NPV of $1.3 million highlight the truly transformative impact this initiative could have on the human condition.

The lifetime benefit-to-cost ratio of 7,163 is a staggering testament to the power of investing in health, cooperation, and peace. It suggests that the LOGICAL Treaty is not just a sound investment but an unparalleled opportunity to create a better world for ourselves and for generations to come.


# Cost of War Per Person

## TL;DR
War Costs the Average Person $30M Over Their Lifetime

To comprehensively quantify the equivalent financial benefits of ending war and the combined net present value (NPV) over a human lifetime, we synthesize data and estimates from various analyses. This involves projecting savings and potential gains from reduced military spending, minimized conflict losses, increased productive investments, and enhanced economic growth over an average human lifespan.

## Calculations

### Direct Savings from Reduced Military Spending

* Annual Savings: [$1,981 billion](https://www.ebrd.com/publications/transition-report-202223-the-economics-of-war-and-peace)
* Savings Over 72 Years (assuming constant spending): $142,632 billion

### Indirect Gains from Productive Investment of Military Spending

* Annual Additional Economic Activity: [$1,981 billion](https://www.ebrd.com/publications/transition-report-202223-the-economics-of-war-and-peace) × 0.5 = $990.5 billion
* Gains Over 72 Years (assuming constant additional activity): $71,316 billion

### Savings from Reduced Conflict-Related Losses

* Annual Savings: [$521 billion](https://www.ebrd.com/publications/transition-report-202223-the-economics-of-war-and-peace)
* Savings Over 72 Years (assuming a 2% annual increase): $58,229 billion

### Savings from Reduced Infrastructure Destruction

* Annual Savings: [$1,875 billion](https://www.ebrd.com/publications/transition-report-202223-the-economics-of-war-and-peace)
* Savings Over 72 Years (assuming constant destruction): $135,000 billion

### Savings from Reduced Trade and Investment Disruption

* Annual Savings: [$616 billion](https://www.ebrd.com/publications/transition-report-202223-the-economics-of-war-and-peace)
* Savings Over 72 Years (assuming constant disruption): $44,352 billion

### Gains from Productive Use of War-Related Resources

* Annual Additional Economic Activity: [$440 billion](https://www.ebrd.com/publications/transition-report-202223-the-economics-of-war-and-peace)
* Gains Over 72 Years (assuming constant additional activity): $31,680 billion

### Gains from Increased Economic Growth

* Assumption: A [0.5 percentage](https://www.ebrd.com/publications/transition-report-202223-the-economics-of-war-and-peace) point increase in global GDP growth due to peace and productive investment
* 2020 Global GDP: $88 trillion
* Projected GDP After 72 Years with 0.5 percentage point annual increase: $382 trillion
* Potential Gain: $294 trillion

### Total Savings and Gains Over 72 Years


$142,632 billion + $71,316 billion + $58,229 billion + $135,000 billion + $44,352 billion + $31,680 billion + $294,000 billion = $777,209 billion


### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

Using a discount rate of 3%, the NPV of $777,209 billion over 72 years is:

NPV = Total Savings and Gains × [Discount Rate1−(1+Discount Rate)−Number of Years​]

= $777,209 billion × [0.031−(1.03)−72​]

= $23,698,571 billion or approximately $24 quadrillion

### Per Capita NPV

Assuming a global population of 7.9 billion, the per capita NPV is:

$23,698,571 billion ÷ 7.9 billion = $3,000,123 or approximately $3 million per person

## Conclusion

The estimated equivalent financial benefits of ending war, considering savings from reduced military spending, reduced conflict-related losses, reduced infrastructure destruction, reduced trade and investment disruption, and gains from productive investments and increased economic growth, amount to a staggering $24 quadrillion in net present value terms over a typical human lifetime. This equates to approximately **$3 million per person globally**.

These figures, while based on numerous assumptions and rough estimates, illustrate the monumental potential economic benefits of achieving world peace and redirecting war-related resources to productive investments. They suggest that the long-term financial value of initiatives that promote peace could be immense, potentially in the quadrillions of dollars.

Of course, the true value of peace goes far beyond what can be captured in financial terms. Yet, this financial analysis provides a compelling economic case for investing in peace and human well-being, underscoring the importance of initiatives like the Global Health Fund not just as moral imperatives, but also as sound long-term economic strategies for the betterment of all humanity.

As we contemplate the future of our world, these figures provide a powerful reminder of the enormous costs of our current path and the incredible potential of a different way forward, inviting us to work towards a world where resources currently devoted to war are instead harnessed for the good of all.
